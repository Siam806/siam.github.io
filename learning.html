        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <br>
        So first off what will you be reading in this section?
        <br>
        You wil be reading about how I learned to code. Why would you want to you might ask? Well very simple if you are a beginner seaking motivation or a professional developer keeping up to date how the new generation is learning their <em>art</em>. So sit back and read.
        <br>
        <h3>HTML, CSS and JS</h3>
        First why I wanted to learn how to code. I wanted to be working with computers ever since the age of 10. Why? Because I loved playing games and spending time on the Ipad. I was playing Clash of Clans and Minecraft PE *cough *cough. But my most favorite game was fifa 13. That was just so cool. So that beeing said i liked spending time on any electronic device. So fast forward from 3rd grade to about a year ago when a girl posted a video in her Whatsapp status of her changing a name on Wikipedia. I was like WHAT! I didn't like it at all that someone was able to do that so I learnd how to change the text. fast forward to half a year ago and that was during my internship of course an IT-company. The first couple of days we were just doing normal interns do. Doing things everybody else can't do or things interns are good at like comparing different companies to the company I worked in. I had another intern who was already in 11th grade. I was 9th. He already was enrolled in IT-courses for a whole year and I wasn't. Then a day came where we met a developer and he gave us the task to build a webpage. I had no idea how so I just copied the basic <em>HTML structure</em> off the internet and pasted in what I wanted. I was satisfied with my results but of course not explain everything. The other intern though already had his <em>HTML courses</em> so he knew the basic structure and was able to even add a background-color by searching on the internet. And as you might expect I wasn't happy about that so I decided to learn HTML. I tried lots of different apps on my phone. Then I found <a href="http://raboninco.com/rExd">MIMO </a> but it had a premium subscription and I haven't got a credit or debit card yet so you might think of what I did. Android phones are able to install APKs ;) So I installed the app and started learning up to now. I have succesfully finished their <em>HTML & CSS courses</em> and I am learning JS. So now you basically have why I started to code and what I used to start off with. Soon I will add how I learned Python... once I have learned it.
