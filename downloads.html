            Here you will find a list with links to the tools that I used on my way.
            <br>
            This list will get bigger eventually the more I learn.

            <h3>Developing for the web</h3>
            <li>
                <strong>Brackets</strong> <img class="bracketsPic" src="bracketspic.jpg">
                <br>
                Because I started to learn HTML as my first language I had to find a good editor wich I would stick to throughout becoming more skilled in the language but it also had to be beginner friendly. I tried out Atom, Sublime, Notepad++ and Kate but by far the easiest was <em>Brackets</em>. Not only did it allow me to install awesome extensions like "Beautify" which sorts the text for you so you can concentrate on the writing and don't have to worry about people not able to understand what you have written. The UI is very simple but has lots of features. Not only does it handle <em>HTML</em> but also of course <em>CSS & javascript</em>. To see the list of <strong>extensions</strong> I have installed click <a href="brackets.html">here</a>.

                <strong>Thonny</strong> <img class="thonnyPic" src="thonnypic.png">
                <br>
                I know you might be thinking why on earth is he using <em>Thonny</em>!?. Well one pro would be how <strong>simple</strong> the UI is. I am still focusing on development for the Web (HTML, CSS, JS) but I am transferring my knowledge from javascript to Python so I won't be learning the most complicated scripts. If you are a total beginner then I can recommend <em>Thonny</em>. Here is an example of what I started with <strong>Thonny</strong>:
